The app let's you log in to your gmail account, loop through your inbox and search for the certain subject of the email to download the attachment (desirably CV). After that you have choice to either keep the email or to refuse it and delete it from your pc, each of these operations is followed with email that gives sender information whether the CV was accepted or not.
